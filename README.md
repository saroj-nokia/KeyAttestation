Android Key Attestation Test App
==============================

This app supports generating, saving, loading, parsing and verifying Android [key and ID attestation](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/keystore/attestation) data.

The app is used for self-testing, so it has no network permission **(NOTE: This fork need network permissions to check online the Revocation List, see** **[8b9d92f](https://github.com/VisionR1/KeyAttestation/commit/8b9d92f25af4d97f660dc8e46132f34b53972de5))**. The certificate revocation data is embedded in the apk and will not be updated online. If the system is compromised, parsing and verifying is not safe, you should save the data to a file and then load the file on another device to verify it.

This app also supports loading certificate chain generated by other software.

**This fork have this extra features:**

- **Language Menu**

- **Copy verifiedBootHash when clicking on Root of Trust item**

- **Add an option to hide certificate info (Secret Mode)**

- **Add support to parse revoked certificates list from remote server**
